I recently link [posted](https://statsnips.github.io/2016/12/20/Bash-Stata-on-Oracle-Grid-Engine-JHPCE/) on submitting Stata jobs to a Linux computing cluster running the Oracle Grid Engine. Here's a quick post on how to submit a R job.

I usually submit a `qsub` job by writing `qsub Scripts/NAME_OF_SCRIPT` into terminal. My R scripts use the following naming convention: `R<PROJECT>_v<NUM>.sh` or `R_018v1.sh` for a R bash file to run the v1 R script in the 018 project (I explain my project organization in another post). The command `qsub Scripts/R018v1.sh` will read the follow script. 

```
#!/bin/bash -l

#$ -pe local 1
#$ -l mem_free=20G
#$ -l h_vmem=22G
#$ -m e
#$ -M alvin@jhmi.edu
#$ -o ofiles
#$ -e efiles

R CMD BATCH ~/ERGOT/000_workspace/018_pump/try_med.R \
~/ERGOT/000_workspace/018_pump/01_logs/output.txt
```

Please refer to my previous post to learn more about the `qsub` options in the lines that start with `#$`. 

Now the the single R line. I usually submit from my work root file so here I write out the full paths to the R file and then provide R with where I want the log file output. Note that the `\` could be removed and the two lines combined. That's it! 

Here's a [gist](https://gist.github.com/alvinthomas/87b9aafe0d2770fd3ee41655bf81abf5).
