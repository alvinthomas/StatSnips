<p>I recently discovered that <a href="https://mintty.github.io/">Mintty</a> is a great way to make your <a href="https://cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> terminal prettier. Mintty made my conversation from Fedora to Windows 10 and Cygwin more palatable.</p>
<p>Like all Cygwin pacakges/add-ons you’ll have to install it using the Cygwin installer. You can find some quick instructions at <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/68511/how-to-improve-your-cygwin-experience-with-mintty/">HowToGeek</a>.</p>
<p>While there are a number of themes out there, I really like <a href="https://github.com/oumu/mintty-color-schemes">this</a> Base-16 inspired set. I’ve also done some other tweaks to make my Cygwin terminal behave like my Mac Terminal (such as transparency when not in focus).</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://gist.github.com/alvinthomas/31b0746810903472a7b1017ea00fec4a">gist</a>.</p>
