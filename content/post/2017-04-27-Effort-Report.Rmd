I wanted to give a quick shoutout to the [Effort Report Podcast](https://twitter.com/theeffortreport) hosted by [Roger Peng](https://twitter.com/rdpeng) and [Elizabeth Matsui](https://twitter.com/elizabethmatsui). Both hosts are faculty members at Johns Hopkins (School of Public Health & School of Medicine) and they discuss issues that any budding academic should consider. 

I've listened to every podcast (some multiple times) and I've even joined the conversation on Twitter.
