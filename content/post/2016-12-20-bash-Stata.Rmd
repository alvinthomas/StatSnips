Some statistical jobs are either too memory-greedy or computationally intensive to run on a local machine. At the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes (JHMI), researchers have access to a Linux cluster running a Oracle Grid Enginge (previously called the [Sun Grid Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Grid_Engine)).

Jobs on the [Joint HPC Exchange](https://jhpce.jhu.edu/) (JHPCE) can be run interactively with the `qrsh` command or through a `qsub` bash submission. JHPCE also has Stata-MP installed so that's another reason why I use it for larger jobs.

I usually submit a `qsub` job by writing `qsub Scripts/NAME_OF_SCRIPT` into terminal. All of my scripts are kept in the Scripts directory and usually named with the convention `run<PROJECT>_<DO>.sh` or `run017_05.sh` for a Stata bash file to run do file 05 in the 017 project (I explain my project organization in another post). The command `qsub Scripts/run017_05.sh` will read the follow script. 

```
#!/bin/bash -l

#$ -pe local 2
#$ -l mem_free=3G
#$ -l h_vmem=4G
#$ -m e
#$ -M alvin@jhmi.edu
#$ -e efiles
#$ -o ofiles

cd ~/ERGOT/000_workspace/017_multi_donor
stata-mp -b do 05_exp_multi
exit

```

The line `-pe local 2` tells the cluster that I'll need two computing cores. For JHPCE users - our current license only allows for 2-cores so there's no benefit to requesting more. 

The lines `-l mem_free=3G` and `h_vmem=4G` tells the cluster that I need 3G of memory allocated to this job. If Stata starts requesting more that 4G, then the job will be aborted. Stata-MP tends to benefit more from computing cores than RAM, so I generally keep these requests low (I often don't go over 1G of actual use). R, on the otherhand, is memory-greedy so I sometimes request 10-20G of memory for complex jobs.

The next two lines, `-m -e` and `-M alvin@jhmi.edu` tell the cluster to send me an email when the job is done. I wouldn't use this line if you're submitting tons of jobs at once, but it's useful for those one-off jobs that will take hours to complete. 

The next two lines, `-e efiles` and `-o ofiles` tells `qsub` to put error files in the efiles directory (located at `~/efiles`) and output files in the ofiles directory (located at `~/ofiles`). 

Finally, we get to the actual Stata part. First I change to the working directory with the `cd` command. Then I run bash stata using `stata-mp -b` - note that you could also write `stata-se -b` or `stata -b` if you don't want to use Stata-MP. On the same line I submit the stata command `do` and the name of the do file. After that runs we'll exit Stata with `exit`.
