<p>Would you be surprised to find out that the figures above were made in Stata? I discover the work of <a href="https://danbischof.com/2015/02/04/stata-figure-schemes/">Daniel Bischof</a> about a year ago and it has changed the way I think about Stata figures.</p>
<p>I have been a long time user of <a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a>, the graphing <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> package by R Guru <a href="http://hadley.nz/">Hadley Wickham</a>. Some of my publication figures using ggplot2 are dozens of lines long. I enjoy fiddling with every aspect of the aesthetic to make a perfectly clear visualization. I also enjoyed making my own <a href="https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes">ggthemes</a> to automate some of my particular preferences.</p>
<p>Then I took a job with ERGOT. Our group loves <a href="http://www.stata.com/">Stata</a>. It seemed like too much work to write everything in R when only one other person could read it. So I decided to dive into Stata graphics and figure out how to make pretty plots. I yearned for that ggplot2 feel and the control of ggthemes. Then came along plotplainblind and plottig.</p>
<p>Bischof’s package is a must have for any Stata user interested in making beautiful figures. While Stata does have some reasonable <a href="http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?schemes">schemes</a> built-in, the simple beauty of plotplainblind makes it my go-to scheme. Moreover, plotplainblind also features colors that are distinguishable to those with color blindness (ggplot2 users can find a color-blind safe palette <a href="http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/">here</a>).</p>
<p>I’ll post a gist in an update to this post.</p>
