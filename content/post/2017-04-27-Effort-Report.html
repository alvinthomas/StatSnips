<p>I wanted to give a quick shoutout to the <a href="https://twitter.com/theeffortreport">Effort Report Podcast</a> hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/rdpeng">Roger Peng</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/elizabethmatsui">Elizabeth Matsui</a>. Both hosts are faculty members at Johns Hopkins (School of Public Health &amp; School of Medicine) and they discuss issues that any budding academic should consider.</p>
<p>I’ve listened to every podcast (some multiple times) and I’ve even joined the conversation on Twitter.</p>
