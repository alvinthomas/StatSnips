I hope to use this space to post code snippets to make my life and the lives of other statistical programmers easier. As an epidemiologist, I use data from national registries and clinical trials to answer interesting questions in public health, surgery, and medicine. I code mostly in Stata and R, but I'm always interested in optimizing my workflow and learning new techniques. I hope you find my thoughts useful!
