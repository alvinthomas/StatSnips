I recently discovered that [Mintty](https://mintty.github.io/) is a great way to make your [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) terminal prettier. Mintty made my conversation from Fedora to Windows 10 and Cygwin more palatable.

Like all Cygwin pacakges/add-ons you'll have to install it using the Cygwin installer. You can find some quick instructions at [HowToGeek](https://www.howtogeek.com/68511/how-to-improve-your-cygwin-experience-with-mintty/). 

While there are a number of themes out there, I really like [this](https://github.com/oumu/mintty-color-schemes) Base-16 inspired set. I've also done some other tweaks to make my Cygwin terminal behave like my Mac Terminal (such as transparency when not in focus). 

Here's a [gist](https://gist.github.com/alvinthomas/31b0746810903472a7b1017ea00fec4a).
